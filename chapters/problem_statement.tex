\section{Statement of the Problem}

The core problem is the \textbf{Infrastructure Asymmetry} in the Indian payment ecosystem.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{POS Terminals:} Expensive and limited reach ($\sim$11 million units). Growth is slow and capital-intensive.
    \item \textbf{QR Codes:} Cheap and ubiquitous ($>$650 million units). Growth is exponential.
\end{itemize}

This 60:1 acceptance gap means traditional credit cards are unusable at the vast majority of merchant locations. The introduction of ``Credit on UPI'' attempts to bridge this gap, but it poses an existential threat to the legacy card infrastructure. If the physical card becomes obsolete, billions in infrastructure investment risk becoming ``stranded assets.''
