\section{Rationale of the Study}

The rationale for this study stems from the transformative potential of ``Credit on UPI'' for all stakeholders.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Merchants:} It offers Zero CAPEX (no POS machine needed) and potential revenue expansion by accepting credit customers.
    \item \textbf{For Issuers:} It enables ``Virtual Issuance,'' significantly reducing customer acquisition and logistics costs.
    \item \textbf{For Consumers:} It provides ubiquitous credit access and a simplified, wallet-less experience.
\end{itemize}

This study is timely for evaluating the impact of the RBI's 2022 circular and providing empirical data to guide industry strategy and policy formulation.
