\section{Research Gap}

Despite extensive literature on digital payments (Cash vs. Digital), there is a critical void regarding the \textbf{``Form Factor War''} within the digital ecosystem itself (QR vs. Plastic).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intra-Digital Cannibalization:} Most studies focus on UPI displacing cash, ignoring its impact on physical cards.
    \item \textbf{Novelty of Credit on UPI:} The specific phenomenon of linking credit cards to UPI is too recent (post-2023) to be covered by existing longitudinal studies.
    \item \textbf{Methodological Gap:} Existing research often relies solely on macro-data or qualitative anecdotes.
\end{itemize}

This dissertation bridges these gaps by analyzing post-2023 data using a mixed-method approach to understand the behavioral and economic dynamics of the potential demise of the plastic card.
