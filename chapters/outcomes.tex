\section{Expected Outcomes}

\textbf{Validation of Partial Substitution:} The study expects to find a ``Bifurcated Spending Model'': UPI will displace cards for low-value transactions ($<$\rupee 2,000), while physical cards will retain dominance for high-value purchases ($>$\rupee 5,000).

\textbf{Confirmation of ATS Gap:} Physical Credit Card ATS is expected to be significantly higher ($\sim$\rupee 5,000) compared to UPI ATS ($\sim$\rupee 1,500), with UPI-linked credit falling in between.

\textbf{Generational Divergence:} Gen Z is expected to show an overwhelming preference for ``wallet-less'' behavior, while older generations may stick to physical cards.

\textbf{Merchant MDR Resistance:} Small merchants are expected to strongly resist MDR on Credit-UPI transactions, potentially threatening wide-scale adoption unless subsidized.
